# Deceision Tree Regression

This ia a Deceision Tree Regression code using Python. The Libraries used for this program are /-

NUMPY, PANDAS, MATPLOTLIB, SCIKITLEARN

The dataset has been provided (taken from an online source), I know this is a bad dataset to work with, especially when it is a 
Deceision Tree problem and it has only one Independent Value/Feature, yet tthis was my first program to work on DTR and hence, 
uploading it on GitHub

#### Happy Coding :)
